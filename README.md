<h1>ToDoList</h1>
This is a an app that mostly uses CSS/HTML and EJS for the front-end, uses Node.JS & Express.JS as a back-end, and MongoDB as a database.

Basic Express.JS is used for connection with the MongoDB database, that stores Image links (except the default items, which are stored locally), image titles and image descriptions!

To display the photos, HTML <input type="radio"> is used. App extensivelly uses flexbox CSS.
